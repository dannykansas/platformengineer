Exercises related to: classes, attributes and methods

Pro-tip: run a specific function from the command line directly like so:
python -c 'import this_filename; my_function(a_parameter,b_parameter)'
(you must be in the directory where "this_filename.py" resides)

# Place any needed module imports here...
# Example: import modulename as mn

class AttribMethods:
    '''
    Complete this class with a class-level attribute,
    an instance-level attribute and two methods
    '''
    def __init__(self):
        return 0

class NumericString:
    '''
    Complete this class so it holds a numeric instance attribute
    and a string instance attribute. Decide on four operators/magic
    methods you want to override for this class and provide custom
    functionalities for these methods based on the data in the class.
    '''
    def __init__(self):
	return 0


def main():
    '''
    For extra points, modify this main function to call instantiate
    instances of your completed classes.

    You may statically define the class parameters that are
    passed in for each instantiation, or utilize a module to
    grab arbitrary parameters from the command line invocation.

    Either is perfectly valid.

# Keep this as-is to invoke main.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
