W2D2 Paired Programming Exercises
=================================

**Before you begin:**

Pair up and work through the following exercises by creating the described function definition. Each function definition increases in difficulty and complexity as you progress. Two skeleton files are provided.

**Additional Tips:**

You’ll need to go hunting for various modules to leverage via importing them into your script. Remember the help() built-in function… and Google.

**Control Flow Structures Exercises (use the file named 'flowcontrol.py'):**
  - Define function 'inhabitant_growth()' that uses a for loop to solve the following problem: "The country of Swaziland has X inhabitants, and its population grows 3% per year. The nation of Djibouti has a population of Y and grows 2% per year. Return in how many years Swaziland will surpass Djibouti."
  - Define a function 'hello_timed_world()' that uses a while loop to print "Hello world!" for ~3 seconds.
  - Define a function 'bad_grades()' that uses 'if'/'elif'/'else' statements to return a letter grade based on a 0-100 integer input.

**Sequences and Iterables: (use the provided file named 'sequitor.py'):**
   - Define function 'alpha_ranger()' that uses range (or xrange) to populate a list or string with all of the lower and uppercased letters from a-z.
   - Define function 'meta_dictionary()' such that - given a sequence of dictionaries with an "id" attribute - builds a new dictionary mapping ids to the dictionaries themselves.
   - Using a dictionary-based pattern strategy, define function 'match_dicts()' that will take an integer and a string (one of second, minute, or hour) representing a length of time and return a timespan object equivalent to that length.
