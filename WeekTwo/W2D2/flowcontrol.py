Pro-tip: run a specific function from the command line directly like so:
python -c 'import this_filename; my_function(a_parameter,b_parameter)'
(you must be in the directory where "this_filename.py" resides)

'''

# Place any needed module imports here...
# Example: import modulename as mn

def inhabitant_growth():
    '''
    Use a for loop to solve the following problem:
    The country of Swaziland has X inhabitants, and its population
    grows 3% per year. The nation of Djibouti has a population of Y
    and grows 2% per year. Return in how many years Swaziland will
    surpass Djibouti.

def bad_grades():
    '''
    Use 'if'/'elif'/'else' statements to return a letter grade
    based on a 0-100 integer input. Be sure to allow for at least
    two significant digits after the decimal point.

    Cut-offs for each letter shall be as follows:

    A = Greater than or equal to 90
    B = 80 to 89
    C = 70 to 79
    D = 60 to 69
    F = Less than but not equal to 60

def main():
    '''
    For extra points, modify this main function to call your
    other completed functions.

    You may statically define the function parameters that are
    passed in for each function call, or utilize a module to
    grab arbitrary parameters from the command line invocation.

    Either is perfectly valid.
