Basics Overview
===============

git is technically a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
    - you can change, stage, and store your code without any network connection
    - can be used as the functional equivalent of a CVCS, without losing the DVCS benefits


MindMixer Git Philosophy 
==========

We use a modified version of a common git workflow called "git flow"

Core traits include:
    - central repo of "truth"
    - each branch should represent one of:
	- feature or "topic"-worth of work
	- a release (these are statically-defined as "qa", "stage", and "master")
	- a hotfix
    - close control of feature branches keeps origin/master as the sole source of "good/vettted" code
    - therefore, feature branches... 
	- are branched from master
	- are merged back into qa
	- move from qa (qa) to stage (stage) to master (prod)
    -
